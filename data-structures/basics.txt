WHAT DO THEY DO?
  Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

WHY SO MANY???
  Different data structures excel at different things.  Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

WHY CARE?
  The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures

  You've already worked with many of them unknowingly!

THERE IS NO ONE "BEST" DATA STRUCTURE
They all excel in different situations...
Otherwise why bother learning them all??



OBJECTIVES
  Explain what a class is
  Understand how JavaScript implements the idea of classes
  Define terms like abstraction, encapsulation and polymorphism
  Use ES2015 classes to implement data structures

How we'll be using classes
  We will be using the constructor and instance methods quite a bit
  We will almost never be using static methods

One gotcha with `this`
  Inside all of our instance methods and constructor, the keyword `this` refers to the object created from that class (also known as an instance)

Recap
  Classes are blueprints that when created make objects known as instances
  Classes are created with the new keyword
  The constructor function is a special function that gets run when the class is instantiated
  Instance methods can be added to classes similar to methods in objects
  Class methods can be added using the static keyword
